# Code of Conduct

We follow the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) Code of Conduct, Version 2.1.

## Our Pledge
We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment‑free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio‑economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:
- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes
- Focusing on what is best for the community

Unacceptable behavior includes:
- Harassment, insults, or other derogatory comments
- Trolling, intimidation, or personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others’ private information
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate

## Enforcement Responsibilities
Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards. They may take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Enforcement
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the maintainers responsible for enforcement at the contact addresses listed in the repository (e.g., in `CODEOWNERS` or repo settings). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter.

## Enforcement Guidelines

- **2. Warning** — A warning with consequences for continued behavior.
- **3. Temporary Ban** — Temporary suspension of participation.
- **4. Permanent Ban** — Permanent removal from the community.
